#Overview

## Installing PiReT

Download the latest version of PiReT from [github](https://github.com/mshakya/PiReT.git) or use `git clone` from command line.

```
git clone https://github.com/mshakya/PiReT.git
```

`cd` into the `PiReT` directory

```
cd PiReT
./bioconda_INSTALL.SH
```

PiReT uses bioinformatic tools, many of which are available in [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io). For installing `PiReT` we have provided a script `bioconda_INSTALL.sh` that checks if the required dependencies are in your path and installs if they are not found (download binaries within the PiReT directory and adds the path to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`) it. Additionally, `sudo` privileges are not needed for installation. A log of all installation can be found in `install.log`

##Test
We have provided small test data set to check if the installation was successful or not. Test `.fastq` files can be found in `test_data/fastqs` and corresponding reference fasta files are found in `test_data/data`. To run the test:

```
cd test_data

# if you are in a LINUX system:
sh ./test_pipeline_linux.sh

# if you are in Mac OS X:
sh ./test_pipeline_MacOSX.sh
```
These shell script automatically creates `experimental_design.txt` and runs the pipeline.

Pipeline run status can be checked in either `process.log` or `error.log`. If the pipeline runs completely a file called `process_current.log` is generated.

## Running PiReT

The pipeline can be run in a multiprocessor server with the ability to submit jobs in a queue system through `qsub` or in a single processor system where all jobs are run sequentially. The former requires a `qsub` system. Also, the current state of pipeline only works for single processor.


```
    perl runPipeline_rRNA_noqsub_commandline.pl [options] -exp exp_descriptfile.txt -d workdir -prokaryote_fasta indexprokaryote.fa -eukarya_fasta indexeukarya.fa -index_ref_bt2 indexfile -gff_prokaryote prokaryote.gff -gene_coverage_ref gene_coverage_reference.fa
```

`-d`: working directory where all output files/directories will be written, user must have write permission.

`-prokaryote_fasta`: comma-separated list of reference genome (prokaryote) fasta files (for making bowtie2 mapping index file). [optional]

`-gff_prokaryote`: comma-separated list of gff files for corresponding reference genome fasta files (contig names must match reference sequence header). [optional]

`-eukarya_fasta` : comma-separated list of reference genome (eukarya) fasta files (for making bowtie2 mapping index file). [optional]

`-gff_eukarya`: comma-separated list of gff files for corresponding reference genome fasta files (contig names must match reference sequence header). [optional]

`-index_ref_bt2`: bowtie2 mapping index file,  if the file exists, pipeline skips this step. [optional]

`-gene_coverage_fasta`: fasta file  (for directional coverage analysis, sequence  must be part of prokaryote mapping reference sequence). [optional]

`-test_kingdom`: desired differential gene expression kingdom (`both` (for both eukarya and prokaryote), `prokaryote`, or `eukarya` (default:`prokaryote`));

`-test_method`: method for determining differentially expressed genes. Options are `EdgeR`, `DeSeq2` (For Deseq2, must have have at least 3 replicates for each group), and `both`. `default`: `both`. 

<!-- `-cpu`: number of CPU to be used (default 1) -->

`-BAM_ready`: if mapping file are provided for samples by users (`yes` or `no`). default: `no`

`-significant_pvalue`: floating number cutoff to define significant differentially express genes, (default=0.001)

`-exp`: A tab delimited file that contains at least 3 columns with following header `ID`, `Rawread_files`, and  `group`. `Rawread_files` must have an absolute path.

`-pair_comparison`: tab delimited file describing pairwise comparison. If the file is not specified, all possible pairwise analysis will be conducted.


## Whats in the working directory (-d)?

Here are the list of directories that will be in `working directory`.

```

ls -R | grep ":$" | sed -e 's/:$//' -e 's/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g' -e 's/^/   /' -e 's/-/|/'

|-differential_gene
   |---prokaryote
   |-----test_prok
   |-------Deseq
   |-------EdgeR
   |-------figures
   |-------significant_gene
   |---------pathway
   |-logdir
   |-samp2
   |---mapping_results
   |---trimming_results
   |-samp3
   |---mapping_results
   |---trimming_results

   |---read_count
   |-----prokaryote

   |-----prokaryote
   |-------test_prok

```

`differential_gene`: contains sub-folders with `EdgeR` and `DeSeq` results (when provided) for `prokaryote` and `eukaryote` or `both`. Direct sub-directory of `differential_gene` can be either `prokaryote`, `eukarya`, or both of those. The folder within it are then named based on the given `gff` files corresponding usually to one organism. The file and directory structure within each folder are mostly similar with few differences, all of which are listed and described below.

- `eukarya/splice_sites_gff.txt`: contains known splice sites, generated using `scripts/extract_splice_sites.py`, a python script part of *HISAT*.
- `sum_exp_stats.txt`: Summary table of number of reads after each major processing (filtering and mapping) of files.
- `RPKM_all_gene.txt`: A table of RPKM calculated per features for each samples.
- `reads.table.txt` : A table of reads mapped to features for each samples.
- `prokaryote.genedesc.rRNA.txt`: subset of `gff` files only containing `rRNA` features.
- `prokaryote.gff`: the whole `gff` file.
- `prokaryote.NonrRNA.genedesc.txt`: subset of `gff` files that only has gene description.
- `prokaryote.NonrRNA.gff`: `gff` file with no rRNA.
- `readcounts.expriment.txt`: table similar to experimental design file with location of `htseq-count` results full path.

`process.log`: report of all the commands/scripts/ that were ran as part of the pipeline.

`error.log`: any error are reported here.

`samp2`: The name of this directory corresponds to sample name. Within this folder there are two sub-folders:

- `mapping_results`
    This folder contains reads mapped using *HISAT2* in following formats. If `splice_sites_gff.txt` is present, **HISAT2** aligns based on known splice sites (`splice_sites_gff.txt`).
        - `.sam`: outputs of *HISAT2* (`forward`, `backward`, `paired`, `Notproperpaired`) and sorted `.sam` files
        - `.bam`: generated from `.sam` with `samtools view -bt index_file .sam < .bam`
        - `.bedgraph`: bedgraph summaries of feature coverage produced using`genomeCoverageBed -split -bg -ibam`
        - `.mapping.log`: Alignment summary file from `HISAT2`

- 2. `trimming_results`
            This folder contains results of quality trimming or filtering. This folder was generated using the same script that filteres reads in [EDGE](https://bioedge.lanl.gov/edge_ui/) pipeline.


`sum_gene_count`: directory with results of reads count per sample. Calculated using `htseq-count  -t gene -q -i locus_tag`. Also see `readcounts.expriment.txt`.

`eukarya.fai`: Indexed reference sequence from `eukarya.fa` using `samtools faidx`. A four column table with NAME, LENGTH, OFFSET, LINEBASES, and LINEWIDTH 

## Removing PiReT

For removal, delete (`rm -rf`) `PiReT` folder, which will remove any packages that were downloaded in that folder. Before removing check if your project files are within PiReT. Additionally, delete paths added to either `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`.
